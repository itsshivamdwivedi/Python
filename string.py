# string iteration method
# t=len(w)
# print(len(w))
# print(f"The lenth of the string is {t}")

# this is the string iteration method
# for a in range(t):
#     print(w[a])
# if we have to print the string reverse order we will do 
# w = w[-1::-1] by this method we can reverse or we can do it by another way
# for a in range(t-1,-1,-1):  in this we are reversing the string in for loop only we are subtracting the length of the string by -1 and then we have to go till zeroth index that's why
# we are subtracting it by -1. and the third -1 is for decrementing the value.

    # print(w[a])
